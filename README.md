# Fencing Manager


[Fencing Manager](https://fencing-manager.herokuapp.com/tournament) is a web application currently under development by Keith Miller.

It is designed to help manage competitive fencers' competition schedules. 

It was developed in Python using the Flask web framework, the SQLAlchemy Object Relational Modelling package and the BeautifulSoup webscraping package. Its application structure is based up the excellent microblog application of [Miguel Greenberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/ "Miguel's blog").
